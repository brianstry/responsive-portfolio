                        <p>I am 29 years of age, enjoy playing game of all kinds and spending time with my family.
                            I Found that i enjoyed web design at a rather young age, though did not know my life would lead me to doing it as a career 
                            untill about two months ago, when I was looking at going back to school, I found the coding bootcamp at 
                            Univerity of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC).  It was only six months of schooling and i would be done and looking for a position in the field.
                            This seemed like the perfect oportunity to start a new chapter in my life.
